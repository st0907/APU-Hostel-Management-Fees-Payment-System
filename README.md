# APU-Hostel-Management-Fees-Payment-System

We developed a Hostel Management Fee Booking System using Java in Apache NetBeans IDE 18. The system is designed to calculate hostel fees based on room type and payment duration (month/semester/year), providing a streamlined and efficient booking experience.

The system supports three user roles, each with specific functionalities:

✅ Manager : Login and registration, Register new users, Update or delete user accounts, Set or modify hostel fee rates, View user feedback and activity logs, Manage own profile

✅ Staff : Login and registration, Process payments for residents, Generate payment receipts, View user feedback, Update personal profile

✅ Residents : Login and registration, Book hostel rooms, View individual payment records, Update account information, Submit feedback
